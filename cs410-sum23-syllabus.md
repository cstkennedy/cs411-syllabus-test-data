# Course Description

**Catalog Description**

Laboratory work required. Provides students with challenges of business
environments in developing a technology based project. Students identify a
societal problem, identify solutions, define project solutions, develop project
objectives, conduct feasibility analysis, establish organizational group
structure to meet project objectives and develop formal specifications.
Students make formal technical project presentations and develop web
documentation. Students prepare a draft grant proposal. 


## Prerequisites

  - Students must have earned a C or better in CS300T.
  - Students must have earned a C or better in CS350 *or* be currently enrolled
    in CS350.


## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will have participated in
the development of a set of documents that define a proposed research solution
to a defined problem supported by formal presentations. Students will be
required to use a combination of 

  - knowledge gained from the series of courses completed at university

  - external experience from business or industry,

  - research efforts of the specific problem areas that are identified by
    mentors.

The problem contains aspects of requirements that a project manager would be
required to solve in a commercial or research environment. Students will
develop plans, analysis documents, and design documents for the various aspects
of the project solution.

The use of current technology in the support of the design and development of
the problem solution is a critical component of the process. Students will take
on the role of project managers and be required to develop management level
briefings through formal presentations.

The development of these briefings is expected to require research along with
interviews of experts in the particular domain. One or more presentations will
be a critical design review that seeks the approval for continuation of the
project.

The various presentations will require students to work as individuals making a
presentation, members of a team to prepare a group presentation as well as
leaders of group efforts in support of the overall project.

## Presentations and Discussion Activities

Throughout the semester... discussion activities will be announced. These
activities will include required discussion board activities. Details will be
discussed during recitation and through Canvas Announcements. Discussion
activities will be used to evaluate each team's project as a whole and each
student's understanding of and contribution to the project. Discussion
performance will be used to adjust individual grades for each presentation. 


# Course Policies

## Honor Policy

The Honor System at Old Dominion University is based upon the integrity of each
student. Any form of dishonesty or deception such as lying, cheating, and
plagiarism constitutes a violation of the Honor System. All material submitted
for grading by a student during the course is to be the student's own work. Any
violations of the honor code may be referred to the honor council for
resolution, and grade sanctions imposed.

The instructor reserves the right to question a student orally or in writing
and to use his evaluation of the student's understanding of the assignment and
of the submitted solution as evidence of cheating. Violations will be reported
to the Honor Council for consideration for punitive action. By CS Dept. policy,
students found to be in violation of this rule will, at the very least, receive
a failing grade in the course and may be subject to stiffer penalties.

## Weekly Progress &amp; Deliverables

Once groups have been assigned, there will be at least one informal
presentation per week. The expected deliverables (e.g., presentation content,
group website) will be discussed during class meetings (lecture and/or
recitation).

The instructor will ask each group to provide a brief summary of both progress
and identified issues. All group members should be prepared to provide a
summary.


## Professionalism &amp; Contribution

Old Dominion University supports a comprehensive evaluation of a student's
achievement in a course as a vital part of the educational process. In support
of this university policy, successful completion of this course includes a
satisfactory performance in the development of formal project documentation
(including presentations).

Any student who fails to collaborate with his/her group in a satisfactory
manner may possibly not pass the course, regardless of overall point total.
Each student will be evaluated based upon demonstrated professionalism and
contribution. Any student who receives poor marks from the instructor and/or
their group members may not pass the class.


## Unsatisfactory Performance

If a student fails to contribute meaningfully within his/her group, or a
student feels he/she cannot contribute meaningfully within his/her group, the
instructor or student may arrange a meeting. The meeting may be conducted
face-to-face, via network conferencing, or via email. The instructor may
consult other CS 410/411W instructors or ask other CS 410/411W instructors to
attend the meeting.

During the meeting the instructor and student will discuss the student's
current contributions and expected contributions moving forward. The instructor
and student will arrange a follow-up meeting. If by the follow-up meeting, the
student has not made the expected (i.e., agreed upon) contributions he/she may
not pass the course.


# Educational Accessibility

  aspect of my class, please present me with an accommodation letter from OEA
so that we can work together to ensure that appropriate accommodations are
available to you.

* If you feel that you will experience barriers to your ability to learn and/or
  testing in my class but do not have an accommodation letter, please consider
scheduling an appointment with OEA to determine if academic accommodations are
necessary.

The Office of Educational Accessibility is located at 1021 Student Success
Center and their phone number is (757) 683-4655. Additional information is
