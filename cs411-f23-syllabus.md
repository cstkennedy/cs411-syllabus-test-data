# Course Description

**Catalog Description**

Laboratory work required. Students write professional and non-technical
documents and continue the development of the project defined in CS 410.
Written work is reviewed and returned for corrective rewriting. Students will
design and develop a project prototype, and demonstrate the prototype to a
formal panel along with delivering the formal product specifications and a
draft formal grant proposal. This is a writing intensive course.


**Expanded Description**

The Professional Workforce Development course sequence (CS 410 and CS 411W)
expands upon the experimental and design approach of typical computer science
curricula by addressing the creativity and productivity required for business
and industrial applications. Students in this course sequence engage in projects
that investigate each stage of transforming a creative idea into an innovative
product.

Writing can comprise as much as 60% of a computer scientist's professional
activities.  The evolution of software engineering into a team-centric process
(possibly across geographic distances) requires the sharing of a wide variety of
documentation with attention to version control and version management.

This course is the writing intensive (W) course for the major, which requires
51% or more of the computed grade be based upon writing assignments. You must
demonstrate the ability to write clearly and accurately for a technically
oriented audience. You will complete graded and ungraded writing exercises.

You will write professional and technical documents, and continue the
development of the project defined in CS 410. Written work is reviewed and
returned for corrective rewriting.

Students will design and develop a project prototype, and formally demonstrate
the prototype.

# Course Policies

## Delivery Method

> The provision of face-to-face lectures and live Zoom streams are contingent
> on the setup of the classroom and supporting equipment, and the general level
> of Covid-19 activity in the Norfolk/Virginia Beach area. If I become
> uncomfortable with the safety precautions being taken, or feel that the 
> classroom environment and equipment detract from the quality of the course,
> then I reserve the right to change to a pure web conferencing delivery mode.

## Due Dates and Late Submissions

Late papers, assignments, prototype contributions, and
presentations/demonstrations will not normally be permitted.

Exceptions will be made only in situations of unusual and unforeseeable
circumstances beyond the student's control, and such arrangements must be made
prior to the due date in any situations where the conflict is foreseeable.

"*I've fallen behind and can't catch up*", "*I'm having a busier semester than
I expected*", or "*I registered for too many classes this semester*" are
\emph{not} grounds for an extension.


## Academic Honesty

*This section is borrowed the CS 330 and CS 350 syllabi as written by Steven J. Zeil.*

Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own work. If an
assignment is **explicitly** described as a team assignment, it must be the
work of the team members only.

The instructor reserves the right to question a student orally or in writing and
to use this evaluation of the student's understanding of the assignment and of
the submitted solution as evidence of cheating. Violations will be reported to
the Honor Council for consideration for punitive action. By CS Dept. policy,
students found to be in violation of this rule will, at the very least, receive
a failing grade in the course and may be subject to stiffer penalties.


**Use of Online Resources**

You may **not** post details of course assignments, projects, or tests at
online Forums, Bulletin Boards, Homework sites, etc., soliciting help.

You may use information that you have not solicited but have located, subject
to the following restrictions:

* Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else's ideas, you must cite
  your sources appropriately. Within code, such citations appear in comments.

    Example:

        /*...*/
        double x = 23.0;
        double xsqrt = sqrt(x);
        // Search algorithm based upon code by S Zeil at
        // https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/functionAnalysis/index.html#orderedsequentialsearch
        int loc = 0;
        while (loc < arraySize && numbers[loc] < xsqrt)
        /*...*/

* Just as when writing a paper, if you use someone else's words (code), you
  must cite your sources appropriately **and** mark the quoted text. Within
  code, such citations appear in comments.

    Example:

        /*...*/
        double x = 23.0;
        double xsqrt = sqrt(x);

        // Begin quoted code from  S Zeil at
        // https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/latest/Public/functionAnalysis/index.html#orderedsequentialsearch
        int loc = 0;
        while (loc < listLength && list[loc] < searchItem)
        {
            ++loc;
        }
        // End quoted code

        /*...*/

* Failure to appropriately cite any such "found code" will be taken as evidence
  of plagiarism.

* The overall principle stated in the first sentence of this section remains in
  effect. "Everything turned in for grading in this course must be your own
  work." If the bulk of your assignment, code, paper, etc., are
  copied, even with appropriate citation, to the degree that, in the judgment of
  the instructor, you have not demonstrated your own knowledge of the course
  material, you will receive a zero for that exercise.


## Attendance

Recitation attendance is not required, but you are responsible for all material
covered and announcements made in class (e.g., assignments given or modified,
due dates established or modified, and handouts). If you are going to miss
recitation, be sure to get notes, handouts, etc., from a groupmate or
classmate.

Students must meet all course deadlines and be present for Prototype
Demonstrations.


## Team Assignment (From CS 410 to CS 411W)

In CS 410 you were assigned to a team. Your team developed an idea and designed
a Prototype. Barring specific conditions, you will remain with your team from
CS 410.

You **will** be assigned to a new team if:

  - It has been more than one semester since you completed CS 410.
  - You are retaking CS 411W.
  - You are completing this course  (i.e., CS 411W) during the summer.

You **may** be assigned to a new team, at the **instructor's discretion**, if
you are unable to work with your CS 410 team. Note the use of *may*.


## Weekly Progress &amp; Deliverables

After Lab 1 (i.e., the first paper), there will be at least one informal
presentation per week. The expected deliverables (e.g., presentation content,
group website) will be discussed during class meetings (lecture and/or
recitation).

The instructor will ask each group to provide a brief summary of both progress
and identified issues. All group members should be prepared to provide a
summary.


## Professionalism &amp; Contribution

Old Dominion University supports a comprehensive evaluation of a student's
achievement in a course as a vital part of the educational process. In support
of this university policy, successful completion of this course includes
satisfactory performance in the development of formal documentation (including
presentations) and the Prototype (Software Solution).

Any student who fails to collaborate with his/her group in a satisfactory manner
may possibly not pass the course, regardless of overall point total. Each student
will be evaluated based upon demonstrated professionalism and contribution. Any
student who receives poor marks from the instructor and/or their group members
may not pass the class.


### Prototype Contribution

The Prototype (Software Solution) is a core deliverable of CS 411W. All students
must contribute to development by

  1. contributing code **continuously** throughout the semester.
  2. contributing meaningful code.
  3. communicating with their group throughout the semester.

Any student who fails to effectively contribute to the Prototype will not pass
the course.


### Unsatisfactory Performance

If a student fails to contribute meaningfully within his/her group, or a student
feels he/she cannot contribute meaningfully within his/her group, the instructor
will arrange a meeting. The meeting may be conducted face-to-face, via network
conferencing, or via email. The instructor may consult other CS 410/411W
instructors or ask other CS 410/411W instructors to attend the meeting.

During the meeting the instructor and student will discuss the student's current
contributions and expected contributions moving forward. The instructor and
student arrange a follow-up meeting. If by the follow-up meeting, the student
has not made the expected (i.e., agreed upon) contributions he/she may not pass
the course.
